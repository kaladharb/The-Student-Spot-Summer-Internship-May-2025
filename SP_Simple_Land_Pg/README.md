CODESPHERE - Modern Landing Page
Hey there! Welcome to the CODESPHERE landing page project. This is a sleek, responsive, and modern landing page built using Bootstrap 4, designed to showcase a company's offerings and engage visitors.

About The Project
I whipped this up to practice my front-end skills, focusing on creating an attractive and functional landing page. It's a great example of how to combine a clean design with Bootstrap's powerful grid system and components.

whai is inside:
Responsive Navbar: A fully functional navigation bar that collapses nicely on smaller screens, making it mobile-friendly.
Hero Jumbotron: A prominent and eye-catching hero section with a compelling headline and a call to action.
Info Panels: A section to highlight key features or services, presented with icons and brief descriptions.
Workingspace Section: A dedicated area to describe the work environment, paired with an image to visualize the experience.
Testimonial Carousel (kind of!): A testimonial section featuring a quote and images of satisfied clients to build trust.
Google Fonts Integration: Using a custom font (Viga) for a more distinct look and feel.
Custom CSS: While Bootstrap handles a lot, I've added some custom CSS to fine-tune the aesthetics and make it truly unique.
